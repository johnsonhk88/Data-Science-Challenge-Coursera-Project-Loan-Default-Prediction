## Two Methods for Churn Prediction Project
1. File "LoadDefaultPrediction.ipynb" use original coursera project environment ,more supported on sklearn library
2. File "LoadDefaultPrediction.ipynb" use my local computer environment, which support more Machine Learning/Deep Learning methods (Pytorch, MLP, XGBoost, LightGBM,  etc), for comparsion the better performance from different algorithms
